# Realistic-Fox-Origin
A custom-made fox origin mod for Minecraft Fabric Origins Mod.\
Language available: Simplified Chinese & English

**Needs Fabric**
(Forge is also possible, but would not be as functional as Fabric)

**Needs Origins Mod (Either Fabric or Forge ver.), Pehkui Mod to function**

Fabric: https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/

Origins Mod: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins

Pehkui Mod: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pehkui

This is my first time writing a mod.

Technically it's not a mod, I just created the datapack first (also my first time) and added the fabric header file then converted it to .jar to make it work in mods folder.

Therefore, in case something breaks, you can add in the comment section, if there's any...
but do not expect too much from me cuz I'm literally new to any of these xwx

I just signed up for github today whats all these buttons do?

Anyways, hope you have fun with this mod ;)

I tried to recall everything I've added to this origin, maybe there are ones I forget about.
