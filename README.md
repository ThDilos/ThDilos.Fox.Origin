# Realistic-Fox-Origin
A custom-made fox origin mod for Minecraft Fabric Origins Mod.\
Language available: Simplified Chinese & English

**Needs Fabric**
(Forge is also possible, but would not be as functional as Fabric)

**Needs Origins Mod (Either Fabric or Forge ver.), Pehkui Mod to function**

Fabric: https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/

Origins Mod: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins

Pehkui Mod: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pehkui

This was my first time writing a mod.

Technically it's not a mod, I just created the datapack first (also my first time) and added the fabric header file then converted it to .jar to make it work in mods folder.

This is also my first Origin, I just kept adding new stuff into it and fixing bugs for more than a year.

Anyways, hope you have fun with this mod ;)

### Before you install:
This Origin is intended for both **Single** AND **Multi** Player environment.\
However, due to the **sheer amount of skills** it has, it _WILL_ bring lag to a less-optimal server.\
Since V4.0, my main focus has shifted from _adding new stuff_ into _maximising performance_, if there is new stuff to be added, it has to be not causing lag as well.\
Because of this, you won't see the me adding stuff like "**Walk on Powder Snow**". I may even have achieved them via Origins and Minecraft Commands, but they are abandoned due to performance cost.

I will try to use Minecraft Fabric / Forge Coding to achieve the powers that should be added but couldn't because of performance issue when I have time and motivation.\
Minecraft Java Modding is a new thing to me, which I have tried to learn in the past but failed as I couldn't understand the existing tutorials.

For now, this Origin is **BEST** to be used in Single Player. It usually has **NO** performance problem when in Single Player.\
If in multiplayer, make sure:
1. **THERE IS NOT MANY MODS**
2. Server is mid-high config
3. There is not many people playing

### Currently Known Incompatibilities
These Incompatibilities are applied to **All Origins** with similar Powers.\
My Fox has **a lot** of Powers, which makes it extra vulnerable to incompatibility issues :(
1. For Forge Side, Alex's Cave will somehow nullify the Night Vision Skill in this Origin [Found by HeartlessRiku369]
   > This problem occurs for all Forge Origin that uses Night Vision, there is no fix for that unless the Forge Origin updates
2. For Forge Side, Entity Culling will cause the Debug Log to go crazy. (And cause you to experience extreme Lag as well?) [Found by Kirybdis]
3. Entity Culling will make the Hunt Skill's Mob sensing terrible
   > The Mod prevents mobs that you can't see from rendering, for performance.\
   > Meanwhile the Mob sensing skill is for you to see mobs across the walls.\
   > This mod would cause you to only see mobs that you can normally see.\
   > Making this skill kinda useless
