2. fox_settings
    Target: Different players in your 5 blocks range
    Function:
        Give you the [Fox Setting Book]
    Explanation:
        This book more information about certain mechanics
        This book contains useful one-time change for you to quickly execute on everyone within range (including yourself)
        This book can totally replace the [Universal Settings] if there won't be any new player choosing this origin in the future

Go to /data/thorigins/powers/fox/universal_settings.json for all the pre-implemented things you can change 

After you changed the settings, the current online players will not be affected!

Instead, if you are in Fabric, do this command:
/function thorigins:refresh_settings

HOWEVER, if you are in Forge, this setting file is only useful for anyone who has yet to choose this origin,
and is straightup USELESS for those who has already chosen this origin.

To change their settings, the only way is for you to MANUALLY do:
/resource set [Player] [Power] [Value]
Fill the [Player] with the person you want to change, or use @a[tag=foxie] to change for every existing fox origin player
Replace [Power] with thorigins:fox/universal_settings_[Setting Name]
Replace [Value] with a numeric value
E.g. 
/resource set @a[tag=foxie] thorigins:fox/universal_settings_op_ness 0
This command will set the op_ness of all current fox origin players to 0.

E.g.2
/resource set @s thorigins:fox/universal_settings_allow_second_pounce 0
This will disable second pounce for the person who is using this command.

Of course Fabric can also use this manual commands, if you want different fox origin players to have different settings.


Here are the explanations for the settings:

---

1. "op_ness"
The higher the "start_value", the more damage will be dealt.
For detailed damage explanation, visit https://github.com/ThDilos/ThDilos.Fox.Origin/wiki/For-Server-Admins#if-you-think-this-origin-is-dealing-an-unusual-amount-of-damage

OP Level is a conventional way to refer to the "How OP is this Origin",
while op_ness is what it is defined in the code file.
100 op_ness = 1 OP Level
E.g By default, op_ness is 400, which is OP Level 4

---

For all the other settings, the "start_value" can only be either 0 or 1
0 means OFF
1 means ON
By default, everything is ON

2. "allow_second_pounce"
The First Active Ability [Pounce] allows the player to pounce twice, at the cost of more exhaustion.

3. "pounce_add_reach"
The First Active Ability [Pounce] will multiply player's reach by 1.15, reset to 1 when the pounce is over.

4. "can_adapt_dimensions"
Player will receive penalties from Passive Ability [Timidity] for being in the end or the nether.
However, by default, if they stay in the respective dimension for 10 minutes, the penalty is permanently removed. (Foxes have strong Adaptation ability)
If this option is set to OFF, player will always receive penalties in the other dimensions without proper protections (Elytra, fire protection etc.) (Given they havn't died 8 times)

5. "food_nerfs"
Player will receive half of the foodpoints and saturations if they eat anything that is not berries / golden foods / small preys meat etc. And there will be a fox.aggro sound being played.

6. "shield_restriction"
Prevent Player from using shield.

7. "heavy_armor_restriction"
Give player penalties for wearing heavy armors.

8. "oxygen_restriction"
Player consume oxygen faster when under water.

9. "enable_sleepin_mode"
Player can turn into a disguise sleeping fox.

10. "mace_nerf"
Player receives panelties when using Mace.
